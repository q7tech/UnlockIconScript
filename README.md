# NOTICE
This repository is archived now because of the release of the new Mega Hack. Though, if you still use the old icon hack that Absolute release ~1 day after 2.2, this script will work just fine.

# UnlockIconScript

A script that runs Absolute's 2.2 Icon Hack

## Usage

1. Download the 2.2 icon hack from [here.](https://www.mediafire.com/file/wv1i59y4go2kcyn/2.2_Unlock_All.exe/file) Make sure its in your `Donwloads` folder.
2. Download the exe file from [here](https://github.com/actuallyarm64/UnlockIconScript/releases/download/v1/UnlockIconScript.exe)
3. Run the exe.
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There's a non-zero chance that your anti-virus will falsely mark this program as harmful. This is because the way it works is it drops a .bat file in your `%temp%` folder and runs it invisibly, similar to how Malware works.<br><br>You may have to mark this program as an exception.

## Making it run in the startup

1. Right-click on your desktop
2. Go to New -> Shortcut
3. For the location, click browse, and select the exe file.
4. Put any name you want.
5. On your keyboard, press Windows + R and type `shell:startup`
6. In the folder that shows, drag the shortcut into the folder.
7. You're done! Now everytime you restart your PC, it will always run in the background.
